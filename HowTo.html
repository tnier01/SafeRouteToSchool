	<div class="explanations">
		<button class="collapsible">What is the application Safe Route about?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>An application to avoid accidents on your routes through the city of M端nster. 
				After submitting the route, different routes can be selected that avoid different risk areas where accidents are more likely to occur in M端nster. 
				All routes are displayed on a map, and it is possible to view additional statistics and to export the routes to Google Maps.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Is there a short way to get an overview about the application?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p> We created a short video, so that you can get an first impression of Safe Route. <br>
				<!--<iframe width="420" height="345" src="TODO">
				</iframe>-->
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">What do the accident markers represent? </button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The accident markers represent accidents happened in M端nster in 2019.
				If you click on one of the markers there will be further information concerning the accident.
				It is shown whether a bicycle or a pedestrian was involved in the accident.
				In addition, it indicates at what time and in which month the accident happened.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">What do the risk areas represent? </button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The risk areas represent areas where a lot of accidents happened, so areas where there is a higher risk
				of being involved in an accident.
				The risk areas are heatmaps based on the density of the accident markers, created initially in QGIS.
				A heatmap with 5 levels was created.
				That means, level 1 has the lowest density of accidents and level 5 the highest density.
				The areas shown in the map are level 3 (low risk), level 4 (medium risk) and level 5 (High risk).
				In the lower right corner you can see a legend concerning the risk levels.
				The areas for level 1 or 2 are not shown, because with this you could drive almost nowhere and it
				does not make a lot of sense to avoid a street just because there happened just one accident within one
				year.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">How can I insert a route?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>With the button in the lower left you can hide and show the route settings.
				You can decide if the routes should be either calculated for cars, for bicycle or for pedestrian.
				You can insert the start and the finish of the route.
				The format for the start and finish (so the way you should input it), is suggested in grey in the start
				and finish input box, if you have not alreay written something in it.
				During writing something in these both boxes, there are suggestions for the place you are searching for.
				By hitting the "Submit"-button, the calculation of the route starts.
				The occuring loading bar in the middle of the screen shows when the calculation is finished.
				You can start a new calculation at any time.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">What is the meaning of the different routes?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Different routes are avoiding different risk areas.
				There are four different kinds of routes.
				The "Shortest route" is avoiding no accidents, the "Low risk avoiding route" avoids areas with a low
				risk for accidents, the "Medium risk avoiding route" avoids areas with a medium risk for accidents and
				the "High risk avoiding route" avoids areas with high risk for accidents.
				You can activate and deactivate the display of the different routes in the layers control in the upper
				right.
				Furthermore there is a corresponding legend right above the "Risk Levels" legend in the lower right.
				This legend adjusts depending on which routes are enabled in the layers control.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Can I export the route to a navigation system like Google Maps?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Yes you can!
				Directly next to the route input, further route information is displayed.
				There you can see the risk level of each route, its duration and its length.
				Furthermore there is a link to Google Maps.
				By clicking this link you export the route to Google Maps.
				In Google Maps you then can use a route description to navigate or send the route description to your
				smartphone, if you are not already using it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">What can I do with the layers control?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>In the layers control in the upper right you can select if you either want to use the OpenStreetMap as
				base
				layer, or the Esri World Imagery.
				Besides you can decide by checking or unchecking the boxes if the Risk areas, so the area where a lot of
				accidents happened, and the Accident markers, so the position of the accidents are shown or not.
				If a route has been entered, it is possible to activate and deactivate the display of the different
				routes.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Am I able to zoom the map in and out?</button>
		<div class="content">
			<p>By the +/- button in the upper left you can zoom in and out the map.
				But there is a limit, the maximal map extent is limited to the region of M端nster.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">What kind of information do the statistics contain?</button>
		<div class="content">
			Statistics are displayed for all routes that have just been calculated. In the selection above the
			statistics you can switch accordingly and decide for which route you want to view the statistics.
			All data were taken from the <a href="https://unfallatlas.statistikportal.de" target="_blank">German
